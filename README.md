# NASSCOMM-VSD-Digital VLSI SoC design and planning(23 APR-6 MAY'25)

Welcome to my documentation for the VSD-IAT workshop! This repository contains my daily learnings, notes, and hands-on work throughout the course.

This workshop focuses on Open-Source ASIC Physical Design Flow, using tools like OpenLane, Magic VLSI, and the Sky130 PDK, allowing students and professionals to gain industry-ready skills in chip design using free and open-source tools.This program, led by industry expert Kunal Ghosh, provides hands-on experience in standard cell design, physical design, and GDSII generation.

## DAY 1
INTRODUCTION

 On Day 1, we began our journey into the VSD-IAT open-source   physical design flow using OpenLane and the Sky130 PDK. The focus was on understanding the overall flow of ASIC physical design and how synthesis fits into the process.

游닂 Topics Covered:

- Overview of the ASIC Physical Design flow
- Introduction to **OpenLane** and **Sky130 PDK**
- Familiarization with the **PnR (Place and Route)** stages
- Understanding the **Design Preparation** stage
- Execution and analysis of the **Synthesis** stage
游댢 Activities Performed:

1. **Explored OpenLane Directory Structure**  
   - Understood where designs, configurations, logs, and results are stored

2. **Initialized a Design with OpenLane**  
   - Set up basic configurations for a sample design (e.g., `picorv32a` or custom RTL)
