## Lab 1 - Task
1)Run 'picorv32a' design synthesis using openLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.

2) Calculate the flop ratio
 = no.of d flipflops/total number of cells
 
 Percentage of DFF'S=Flop Ratio*100

 ## Result

 Calculating  the flop ratio
 = no.of d flipflops(1613)/total number of cells(14876)

 0.1084
 
 Percentage of DFF'S=Flop Ratio*100
 
 10.84

游늷 Key Learnings:
 1) Floorplanning is a crucial stage that defines the chip's physical structure

 2) LEF/DEF files help in transitioning between logical and physical views of a design

 3) Special cells ensure reliability, manufacturability, and electrical correctness

  4) Placement quality directly impacts timing, congestion, and chip performance

游눠 Reflection:

  Day 2 focused heavily on physical organization, setting the stage for successful routing and performance optimization later. Understanding LEF/DEF and seeing how physical rules are applied was eye-opening. Proper floorplanning and placement are critical to achieving good PPA (Power, Performance, Area) targets.
